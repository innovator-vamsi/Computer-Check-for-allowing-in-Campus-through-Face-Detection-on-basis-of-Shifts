# Introduction

Mankind has observed various pandemics throughout the history where some of them were more disastrous than the others to the humans. We are observing a very tough time once
again fighting an invisible enemy; the novel COVID-19 Coronavirus. Initially observed in the Wuhan province of China, now fastly spreading around the world.

# COVID-19 Report

Till, 13th June, 2020, there are 7,799,243 Coronavirus cases, with 429,870 deaths while 4,001,077 has been recovered.
In India till, 13th June, 2020, there are total 317,368 Coronavirus cases, with 9,109 deaths while 159,597 has been recovered. 

# Problem Statement
Presently nearby 3 Months the schools and colleges have been closed. Also the
Government has stated that it is possible to open the schools and colleges by August 1st Week
with some restrictions.
 In that restrictions the one main restriction is to run the schools and colleges by 50% of
the student’s i.e. From 7AM to 1PM 50% of students will attend the school or college and
From 1PM to 6PM the remaining 50% of students will attend the school or college. But there
are some chances that morning shift person can come to evening shift without caring anything
or vice versa and also it is impossible to check the every student who is coming to the campus
that he is morning shift or evening shift.
 By this it is hard to maintain the shifts in the School or College. 
 
 # Solution
 
 For this problem I implemented a project named “Computer Check for allowing in
Campus through Face Detection on basis of Shifts” which is designed used the
programming languages Python and HTML.
 This project will provide the information of the student who is standing in front of the
camera that which shift he belongs to or unknown person.
 It can be implemented at the main gate of the campus and it is continuously observed
by the Security that he is allowed or not.
 By this project we can maintain only 50% of the students exactly.
 In an online articles they said the shifts are going to implement.
